        <p class="lead mb-4">My passion for business in the finance sector started when I was in highschool. I would always see my grandpa trading stocks early in the morning before school. Eventually, I started looking into stocks and options. I found it fascinating how millions of stocks from many different companies were being traded at an instance. I created two accounts, one for long term stocks and the other for risky options plays. I had to research a lot by reading and watching articles and videos from experts to get a solid idea of the concept of stocks and how to trade them. Around that time, I started working for a car auto shop where I helped fulfill orders on the computer and kept track of the expenses with a balance sheet. I also interned over the summer at another company where I shadowed the treasure. The day consisted of watching him make spreadsheets on Excel and waiting outside the conference room while he attended important meetings. I also volunteered at a local school where my friend and I coached a middle school basketball team. From this, I developed good communication skills since I had to constantly talk to each person on the team and tell them what they were doing well or wrong. I also started my own dropshipping website where I sold LED light projectors. It wasnâ€™t as easy as I thought it was. I had to contact a supplier in China for these products which took about a month for the goods to arrive. I used Shopify to create my website and Facebook and Google Ads for my advertisements. I watched tons of Youtube videos to learn how to fully function my website and advertisements and overall run my business. Although my revenue was decent with around two-thousand dollars, the costs of people disputing my items, ad costs, and the shopify subscription had cost me an arm and a leg. So in total I profited around $400. In the end, I donâ€™t regret anything from my Shopify business. It provided me with some transparency of how online businesses are run. I also learned lots of different things from running a Shopify website and how advertising and the layout of your website impacts sales. I plan on starting up an Amazon FBA business very soon so I can create another source of income. For my scholarly achievements, I donâ€™t have a lot since I am currently a freshman at UC Riverside. I am majoring in Finance at the moment but I plan on starting my own business while also investing in Real Estate properties. I have started looking into Real Estate wholesaling and getting my real estate license. However, I started my real estate license course during school and because it is very long, I only finished part of it for now. Even though I know this process will take a while, I feel like it is worth it since it interests me a lot and it can provide a financially stable future for me. <br><br>
